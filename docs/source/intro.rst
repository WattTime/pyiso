Introduction
=============

Pyiso provides Python client libraries for ISO and other power grid data sources.
It powers the `WattTime Impact API <https://api.watttime.org/>`_,
among other things.

What's an ISO?
---------------

Electricity markets are operated by "balancing authorities,"
which manage supply and demand for a given service area.
The bigger balancing authorities, called
Independent Services Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations
(`ISOs/RTOs <http://www.isorto.org/>`_, or simply ISOs),
together cover about 2/3 of US electricity consumers.

ISOs are required to provide real-time data about electricity market operations,
but choose to do so in a wide variety of unstandardized, inconvenient formats.
Some smaller balancing authorities provide data too.

What's included
----------------

Pyiso makes it easier to collect data from ISOs and other balancing authorities
by providing a uniform Python interface to each data stream.
See the :doc:`usage` page for instructions on how to get started.

Specifically, here are the included balancing authorities and their respective data sources:

Note: Some balancing authorities offer data directly and through the EIA client.
