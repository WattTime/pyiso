Supporting
==========

Pyiso is an open source project maintained by `WattTime <http://WattTime.org>`_,
a nonprofit that develops software standards to
reduce power grid pollution and enable new kinds of clean energy choices.

We've spent more than 1000 developer-hours
building pyiso, keeping it up-to-date with evolving data sources,
and adding features requested by the community.
As the foundation of our internal data pipeline,
it makes our work easier every day.
And we've made it free and open source because we want to
make open energy data access a bit easier
for other researchers, engineers, and citizens too!
